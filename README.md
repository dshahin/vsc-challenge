# goodbye-world README

Sometimes you just need to fill some space with vaguely familiar words.

## Features
Highlight some text and use Goodby World to use the selection as input for a new sentence generated using Markov chains.
Then use a custom decorator to highlight the new sentence.  Almost useless, but fun to work on!


**Enjoy!**
